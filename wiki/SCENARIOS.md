# User cases
### What should the user be capable of ?
All following points require the user has installed the app and created a profile, 
requiring a profile picture and a pseudo. Then a user can :

* Post a new picture of a lunchbox
* Swipe pictures of other users's lunchboxes. These images are provided by the algorithm. 
Swipe left an image means a dislike, or at least non-interest. Swipe right means a like.
* See other user's profile by clicking on his pseudo while swiping.
* See other user's profile by searching his pseudo.
* Open the map of the area and see where there are other users.
* Click on an other user displayed on the map and see his profile.
* While seeing a profile, browse and swipe all pictures of this user.

If two users like an other's lunchbox, it's a Match. Each user can start chatting
with each other.

### Example 1
* User 1 downloads and installs the app. It creates an account or uses his Google one.
* User 1 cooks a lobster, puts it into a Tupper, takes picture and posts it on the app.
* User 1 swipes right randomly one of User 2's recipe.
* User 2 swipes left several Tupps but likes User 1's lobster. It swipes it right.
* The app informs both users they have a Match.
* Both users start chatting. They agree on a rendezvous to exchange their lunch and talk to each other.
* The meeting happens.

### Example 2 (with location and Google Maps integration)
* User 1 opens the app. On the Map screen, it sees that User 2 lives in the same town.
* User 1 swipes pictures of User 2 and likes one of them.
* User 2 applies same approach, a Match happens.
* Both users agree on a rendezvous.
