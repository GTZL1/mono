## Structure

We use a mono-repository approach to store and manage the files of our project. We also make use of some external tools for [time tracking](https://clockify.me) and [prototyping](https://www.figma.com).

The sub-folder structure is as follows:

- `.github/` contains GitHub-specific files, such as issue templates, and the workflows that run whenever we make changes to the app;
- `wiki/` contains our reference branding, details over our collaboration process; and
- `website/` contains our landing page.

**Our prototypes are visible on Figma ([overview](https://www.figma.com/file/sZTqSZOMoUmuJTMhw7khx3/Mobile?node-id=1%3A2), [live prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/sZTqSZOMoUmuJTMhw7khx3/Mobile?node-id=158%3A380&viewport=849%2C581%2C0.3042562007904053&scaling=scale-down)).**

> We are still [in the process](https://github.com/heig-PDG/mono/issues/30) of figuring out a way to export time tracking reports.

## Building and installing

> This will be specified once we start having a better idea of the technical stack we'll be using.

## Time tracking

Since we're using Clockify to track the time for the project, we thought that it'd be useful to monitor the time invested every week.

### Overview

This table represents the total time invested. It will be updated weekly.
